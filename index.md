## About Me

<img src="assets\images\证件照.jpeg" class="floatpic">

Hi, I'm **Benteng Sun (SMARK, 孙奔腾)**.<br>

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Data Science (Mathematics Category) at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (expected graduation in 2026). My research focuses on machine learning, compressed sensing, and computational imaging under the supervision of [Prof. Yongyong Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ny2mn-cAAAAJ).

I have published research at prestigious venues like ICLR and participated in top-tier competitions. I'm currently exploring innovative computational methods to tackle challenging problems in image reconstruction, spectral imaging, and medical imaging.

**I am actively seeking PhD opportunities for Fall 2026**, aiming to deepen my research in advanced machine learning and computational imaging.

Feel free to contact me at **220810225@stu.hit.edu.cn**.
