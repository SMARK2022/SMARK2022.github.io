## About Me

<img src="assets\images\个人照片.webp" class="floatpic">

Hi, I'm **Benteng Sun (SMARK, 孙奔腾)**.<br>

I'm an undergraduate student in Data Science (Mathematics Category) at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (graduating in 2026).  
My research centers on machine learning, sparse representation, and computational imaging, advised by [Prof. Yongyong Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ny2mn-cAAAAJ).

I have published at ICLR and participated in top-tier competitions.  
Currently, I am exploring efficient and controllable generation paradigms, aiming to build scalable frameworks for images, videos, and 3D content.

      Developed a novel subspace diffusion refinement framework for spectral compressive imaging (SCI), recovering high-frequency details from minimal measurements.  
      Achieved 38.14 dB PSNR on KAIST dataset with 10× speedup over existing diffusion models.  
      <small>Keywords: spectral imaging, sparsity modelling, diffusion refinement</small>

## Research Experience & Interests

### Research Interests

My research bridges theoretical modelling and practical algorithm design, currently focusing on:

- **Multimodal Understanding & Generation**
  (cross-modal synthesis, language-guided visual generation, modality fusion)

- **Generative Modeling and Controllable Generation**  
  (structure-guided diffusion, efficient sampling, scalable 2D/3D/video frameworks)

- **Computational Imaging & Low-Level Vision**  
  (spectral imaging, MRI acceleration, physics-driven restoration, compressed sensing)

I am particularly interested in advancing new generation paradigms that integrate **multimodal understanding**, sparse structures, and efficient computation across 2D, 3D, and video modalities.

### Competitions & Projects

- **The 19th "Challenge Cup" National Competition (First Prize)**  
  Achieved over 95% accuracy in radar-infrared fusion object detection under limited-sample, noise-intensive conditions.

- **NTIRE Challenge (CVPR 2025)**  
  Developed a novel diffusion-based image restoration system, compressing model parameters from 1.77B to 2.2M while retaining high visual quality.

- **MetaMusic: Cross-Modal Music-Driven Visual Generation** *(Top 1/83 in Freshman Project)*  
  Designed a cross-modal generation pipeline using CLIP embeddings for music-to-image translation. [💻 **Project**](https://github.com/SMARK2022/MetaMusic)
