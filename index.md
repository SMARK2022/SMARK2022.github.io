## About Me

<img src="assets\images\证件照.jpeg" class="floatpic">

Hi, I'm **Benteng Sun (SMARK, 孙奔腾)**.<br>

I'm an undergraduate student in Data Science (Mathematics Category) at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (graduating in 2026).  
My research centers on machine learning, sparse representation, and computational imaging, advised by [Prof. Yongyong Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ny2mn-cAAAAJ).

I have published at ICLR and participated in top-tier competitions.  
Currently, I am exploring efficient and controllable generation paradigms, aiming to build scalable frameworks for images, videos, and 3D content.

**I am actively seeking PhD opportunities for Fall 2026**, focusing on structured generation, sparsity-aware modelling, and computational imaging.

  Integrated radar and infrared data for small object detection under limited samples and noise. Achieved 95% accuracy with 36 ms/frame latency. National First Prize, 19th "Challenge Cup."

- **Fast MRI Reconstruction via Diffusion Models (Nov 2024–Present)**  
  Developed innovative approaches for accelerated MRI reconstruction, integrating prior knowledge for efficient and reliable recovery. Submitted to a top-tier conference.

- **Sparsity-aware Conditioning for Generative Models (Ongoing)**  
  Working on scalable and controllable generation methods leveraging structured sparsity for diverse modalities.

### Research Interests

My research bridges theoretical modelling and practical algorithm design, currently focusing on:

- **Generative Modeling and Controllable Generation**  
  (sparsity-aware generation, structure-guided diffusion, efficient sampling)

- **Compressed Sensing and Sparse Optimization**  
  (signal reconstruction, structural sparsity, underdetermined recovery)

- **Image, Video, and 3D Reconstruction/Generation**

- **Low-Level Vision and Computational Imaging**  
  (spectral imaging, MRI acceleration, physics-driven restoration)

I am particularly interested in advancing new generation paradigms that integrate sparse structures, efficient computation, and general-purpose applicability across modalities.
