# About Me

<img src="assets\images\fav.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Benteng Sun (SMARK, 孙奔腾)**.<br>

I am an undergraduate student in Data Science at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (Class of 2022, expected graduation 2026). Currently, I am conducting research in compressed sensing and image processing under the guidance of [Prof. Yongyong Chen](https://cyyhit.github.io/). My **ICLR-2025** submission has received review scores of 8, 8, 6, and 6 (average 7.0, top 4.79%). I welcome any discussion on research or collaboration; feel free to contact me at 220810225@stu.hit.edu.cn.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of:
- Machine Learning
- Compressed Sensing
- Image Reconstruction
- Multispectral Imaging
- Medical Imaging

My current research focuses on developing advanced machine learning approaches to address fundamental challenges in imaging systems. I am particularly interested in applying computational techniques to enhance image quality while reducing hardware constraints and acquisition costs. This work spans multiple imaging modalities, from multispectral to medical imaging, with the ultimate goal of making high-quality imaging more accessible and efficient.

Through the synergy of machine learning and compressed sensing, I aim to push the boundaries of what's possible in computational imaging, working towards solutions that can have meaningful impact in both scientific and clinical applications.
